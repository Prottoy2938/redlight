# Existential Crisis and Some Musics to Extend it

Thinking about your existence? Why are you in this universe? What's your purpose?

This is a feeling that happens to some of us often.

Why does this happen? What goes on through your mind during this existential crisis?

- I don't know

Do We enter a new dimension during this typeof thoughts? Don't know. Do we become philosopher during this period? Don't know that one too.

People tend to be alone when they reach this state.

## Bringing it Up

Why and Where does this feeling comes from?
I don't have a solid answer. But heres some ways I've seen which brings up this kinda thoughts.

## Getting out of It

I don't know a clear way. I think you should hang out with friends, go the park, travel, help people, or get a pet.
